Don Boudreaux recently wrote a [post][link] over at Cafe Hayek that inspired me to reflect on the importance of understanding economic principles.  Here are four ways that economic principles have shaped my thinking:

* Economics requires disciplined thinking.  I try to avoid mistaking results for causality by looking beyond immediately perceived phenomena.

* Economics is a science of tradeoffs.  I constrain my thinking with the practical tradeoffs that attend all choices in reality.  I recognize that reality's constraints are far tighter and more inflexible than my romantic side fancies them to be.  I recognize the fact that not everything that is good is worth the cost of its achievement -- and that not everything that is bad is worth the cost of its obliteration.

* Economics must consider the imperfections of reality.  I try to avoid romantic notions of the knowledge of people wielding power and their ability to engineer solutions.

* A market takes into account far more information than any single individual can.  A functioning market is a complex discovery process that selects which individual goals are most valued by society.  Functioning society is a spontaneous order that maximizes the prospects for individuals to each pursue their own individual goals with as much success as possible.
