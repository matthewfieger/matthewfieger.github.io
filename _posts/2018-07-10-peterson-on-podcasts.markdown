{{ page.source }} on podcasts:

> The problem with books and videos is that you can't do anything else while you are doing them....If you are listening to a podcast you can be driving...exercising or doing the dishes.  What that means is that podcasts free up say two hours a day for people to engage in educational activities that they wouldn't otherwise be able to engage in.  And that is about one-eighth of people's lives.  So podcasts hand people one-eighth of their life back to engage in high level education.
