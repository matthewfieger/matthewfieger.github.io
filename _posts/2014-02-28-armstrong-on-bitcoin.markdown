{{ page.reference }} [on Bitcoin]({{ page.source }}):

> An open payment network is a game changer...so why hadn’t an open payment network existed previously? Until recently, many people thought it wasn’t possible to build a payment system on an open network. The core issue was around preventing duplicate spending without using a central company to verify each transaction. Nothing prevents you from sending duplicate emails multiple times, for example, if you wanted to do this.

> This problem (the “double spending” problem) is what Bitcoin solves, and in this sense it truly was a technological breakthrough or invention (one that I think will be viewed as very important historically). If you’re someone in the business of verifying transactions on a proprietary network, the invention of Bitcoin cannot be safely ignored. It will change or disrupt the providers of most proprietary payment networks in the coming years.
