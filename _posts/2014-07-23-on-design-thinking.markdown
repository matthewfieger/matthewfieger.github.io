Design thinking is the Copernican Revolution of business in that it puts the user at the center of strategy development, rather than the organization.  Design thinking shifts the focus from understanding competitors and capabilities to understanding what problems can be solved for the user.  Analysis is more customer-centric than business-centric and action is oriented more towards advancing solutions than towards understanding problems.

As such, deign thinking is a paradigm shift.  It changes the perspective and overcomes limitations inherent in the previous paradigm.  Below are several dimensions on which design thinking differs from the previous paradigm:
