{{ page.source }} on design thinking:

> Business thinking favors analytical approaches; decision-making processes demand "proof" that we have arrived at the "correct" answer, so MBAs favor a Business Case.  Design, in contrast, favors trying over extensive planning and is overwhelmingly experimental in its approach. Designers expect to iterate their way to increasingly "better" answers; so designers favor Rapid-Prototyping.

Design thinking assumes instead human experience, always messy, as its decision driver and sees true objectivity as an illusion. Reality, for designers, is always constructed by the people living it.
