> Prices are conveyors of information about relative scarcity.  Prices of consumer goods indicate how much value people place on different items.

The ability to buy all the necessary inputs and still sell the consumer goods for a profit is a signal that entrepreneurs have created value for society by transforming valuable inputs into a more valuable output.  Losses are a signal that entrepreneurs are destroying value by taking scarce resources that could have been used to produce something else and turning those resources into less-valuable final consumer goods.  The marketâ€™s profit and loss system provides the feedback on which businesses and industries should expand and which contract.
