{{ page.source }} on The Constitution:

> But the real irony is that conservative politicians and states ever opposed Tesla at all. The widespread franchise rules giving car dealers virtual monopolies in their territories epitomize the government-controlled marketplace Republicans purportedly despise. The rules themselves date back to the early 20th century when General Motors and Ford were monoliths and dealers were actually powerless.

> Today the bans on Tesla stores are such a naked example of stifling innovative competition to protect an incumbent industryâ€™s business model that they look positively French. Few capitalists today embody the Ayn Randian entrepreneur-as-hero persona quite as convincingly as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who also runs Space-X and Solar City. Yet until this week, at least, the GOP was happy to make him an enemy.
