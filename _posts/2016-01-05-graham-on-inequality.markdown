{{ page.source }} on economic inequality:

> Since economic inequality per se is not bad, we should not attack it. Instead we should attack the bad things that cause it...attacking economic inequality would be doubly mistaken. It would harm the good as well as the bad causes. But even worse, it would be an ineffective way to attack the bad causes. We will not do a good job of fixing the bad causes of economic inequality unless we attack them directly. But if we fix all the bad causes of economic inequality, we will still have increasing levels of it, due to the increasing power of technology.
