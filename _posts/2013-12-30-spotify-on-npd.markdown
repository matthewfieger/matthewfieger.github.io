> The most important part of the product definition is the narrative. What story are we going to tell the world?
What will the press release look like?...

> ...The key thing here is: the narrative is written before the product is built! That way we make sure that the
product is compelling before we even build it.

> In addition, the Think It squad builds lots of different prototypes to experiment
with the look & feel of this product – both “lo-fi” paper prototypes and “hi-fi”
runnable prototypes (but with fake data sources and such). Internal focus
groups are used to help figure out which prototypes best convey the narrative,
until we’ve narrowed down to just a few winning candidates.

> This is an iterative process with no deadline. The product is simply not worth
building until we can show a compelling narrative and a runnable prototype that
fulfills it, and we can’t decide upfront how long that will take.
