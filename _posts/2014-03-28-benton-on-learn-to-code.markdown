{{ page.source }} on learning to code:

>The recommendation to simply “learn to code” feels slightly off to me, because it doesn’t really encompass what programming and writing software is all about: actually building stuff.

> The phrase “learn to code” carries with it the subtle implication that “coding” or “programming” alone is a worthwhile end in itself. But it’s really not, and we shouldn’t be giving that impression to those just starting out with software development.

> Instead of “learn to code”, we should encourage newcomers to “learn to build”. Code is just a tool for building things. And since software is one of the most powerful things a person can build, it makes sense that more people should learn to build it. Learning to code is the first step in learning to build software, but the learning can’t stop there.
