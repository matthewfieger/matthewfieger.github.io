  <h4>Hello & Welcome&nbsp;| اهلا&nbsp;وسهلا | Roj&nbsp;baş</h4>
  <p>
    Welcome to my homepage.  I maintain this page for my own personal development.  For the most part, I post quotes that I think are worth consideration and reflection.  Once in a while, I will post original content.  I am always trying to clarify my beliefs based on the best available information, so don't expect me to forever stand by every belief expressed here.  To get a general idea of what I am interested in, below is list of topics that I have posted on, weighted by frequency:
  <div class="well">
    </p>
    {% for tag in site.tags %}
       <span style="font-size: {{ tag | last | size | times: 1000 | divided_by: site.tags.size | plus: 100 }}%">
      {{ tag | first | replace: ' ', '-'}}
      </span>
    {% endfor %}
  </p>
  </div> <!-- /.well -->
</div> <!-- /#home -->
