I am a disciplined thinker.  I try to avoid mistaking results for causality by looking beyond immediately perceived phenomena.

I constrain my thinking with the practical tradeoffs that attend all choices in reality.  I recognize that reality's constraints are fartighter and more inflexible than my romantic side fancies them to be.  I recognize the fact that not everything that is good is worth the cost of its achievement - and that not everything that is bad is worth the cost of its obliteration.

I understand that reality is imperfect.  I avoid romantic notions of the abilities of people wielding power, as well as the trustworthiness of such people.

I view functioning society as a spontaneous order that maximizes the prospects for individuals to each pursue their own individual goals with as much success as possible.  The market is a complex discovery process that selects which individual goals are most valued by society.

Inspired by [Don Boudreaux][link].
